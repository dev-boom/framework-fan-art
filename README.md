### What is this?

It's frame.work fan art! Since @pixelforest request for SVG files, I might as well create GitHub for it!

All files are in SVG format.

I am not a graphic designer.

### Can use this or modify this?

Yes but please follow the rule of

```
If youâ€™re creating stuff for personal use or non-commercial sharing with friends, feel free to go ahead.
```

Also I have no idea what's difference among open source licenses so in simple english term "It's free but don't sue me."
